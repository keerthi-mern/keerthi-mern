Developed a deep learning model for generating image captions using the Flickr dataset.
Explore the fascinating world of image captioning with Python! In this deep learning tutorial, leverage the power of the Flickr dataset to train a model that generates descriptive captions for images.
In this project, we will build an image caption generator to load a random image and give some captions describing the image. We will use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM) for Natural Language Processing (NLP). BLEU Score for Validation.
